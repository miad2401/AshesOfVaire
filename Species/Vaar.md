Vaar
============

### Homeworld/Home System Description: 
The Vaar homeworld, Vaari Prime, orbits a supermassive black hole rotating near the speed of light. Their world is cast in an eternal twilight, bathed in the baleful red glow of the accretion disk. Vaari Prime is an ocean planet, dotted by volcanic island chains.

### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc):
The Vaar are a humanoid reptile species native to Vaari Prime. They are aquatic, and require liquid water to obtain oxygen. Vaar have pale white scales, colored by lead oxide as a shield from Vaariax A’s radiation output. Most Vaar wear rebreather units over their neck gills when on ships with other species. They have a set of pseudo-lungs that are used for speech, but they can only breathe through the gills on the side of the neck, and their sides.  
Vaar have three sexes, Male, Female and a sterile neutral sex, with sex determination being done via temperature during gestation. They tend to be matriarchal. 

Vaar are generally pro-democracy, pro-freedom, and very militaristic. They will use their sense of honor and duty to protect those they think need protection, and to liberate those who they think are oppressed. They were a founding member of the UAS until the Devastation of Vaire, and now they are the leaders of a large military alliance. 

Vaar corporations such as Vaari Dynamics, ElectroDyne, and AndaraCORP manufacture most of the military vessels, weapons, and combat suits used by both the Vaari Republic and Hykqin Free Worlds. 

Vaar age at the same rate as humans. 

  
Quote: “The billions of lives cut short in the Tragedy shall not go unanswered. It should not come as a surprise that when we saw you fail, we would seek an alternative to your cowardice. The UAS is no more, for we cannot let the pointless bickering of others hold us back from defending those who need us the most.”
