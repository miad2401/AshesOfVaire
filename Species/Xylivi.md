### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc)
The Xylivi are an eldritch species native to Transit Space. They appear as monochromatic reflections of other species, with their extremities fading into an iridescent black slime-like substance. They do tend to be friendly, if naive, but they always have an air of mystery about them. They are the only known lifeform from Transit Space that is not hostile. 

Quote:  “When you look into the unknown, sometimes it looks back. sometimes it also offers you tea.”
