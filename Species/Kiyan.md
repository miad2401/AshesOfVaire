### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc)
Kiyans are a peaceful humanoid species, resembling what many would call “cat people”. Kiyans were genetically engineered millions of years ago by a precursor species, uplifted from a pre-sapient species and modified to dominate their homeworld and take to the stars. 

Kiyans are generally similar to humans, although they were modified from a more feline-esque species. They stand at about 5.6 feet tall, and look nearly identical to humans bar a pair of feline ears and a natural “shell” made of a flexible metallic substance on their arms, sides, and neck.  
Kiyan society tends to be pacifistic, focusing more on diplomacy than on war. They have a massive spy network across the Quadratus Arm, and use a combination of genuine friendliness and subterfuge to get their way. They have only a tiny fleet of ships to guard their space instead of a full military.

Kiyans have two sexes, and tended to be matriarchal for most of their history. 

Kiyans age at the same rate as humans. 

The Talarr Consortium is a Kiyan megacorporation that manufactures mostly consumer goods and extremely cheap civilian ships.They are known for being fairly controversial, even to the point that the Kiyan Federation’s government had to kick them out of Kiyan space due to repeated violation of Federation laws ranging from worker’s rights violations to violations of antitrust legislation, to manipulating the election of Kiyan officials.
