Illixe
=========

### Homeworld/Home System Description: 
The illixe hail from Illenia, a planet tidally locked to a red dwarf star. Their world is battered by harsh storms due to the thermal gradient from the tidal lock.

Layout: Ilyia, Illenia, Averax 1 (mining colony, high-metal world), gas giant Ilyia IIIa, gas giant Ilyia IIIb (binary with Ilyia IIIa)

Home Star: Ilya (red dwarf)  


### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc):
The Illixe are a humanoid insect species native to Illenia. They tend to be semi-translucent, with a cartilaginous skeleton. Illixe are obligate herbivores, and cannot digest meat. They tend to be shorter than humans, at merely 3 feet tall on average. They appear relatively androgynous.  
Illixe skin tones range from pale blue to pale green. They possess antennae capable of echolocation. 

The Illixe are generally xenophobic isolationists, having grown fearful of the stars after the Devastation of Vaire. The few who stray into the galaxy at large are seen as insane by their more fearful brethren.  
Illixe are a single sex species, and reproduce via controlled parthenogeneis. All Illixe are clones of their parents, minus genetic variation due to mutation and horizontal gene transfer via viruses on their homeworld..  
Illixe age slightly slower than humans, at 1.3 Illixe years to 1 human year. 

  
Quote: “We have ventured too far, and the universe screams its protest by killing billions of our allies, our comrades. We cannot risk provoking this kind of massacre again. We must return to our worlds, the stars no longer call to us.”

### Androids
Illixe androids tend to be noticeably made of plastics, and tend to use a faceplate screen to show expressions. They do not look like Illixe beyond their humanoid body plan.
