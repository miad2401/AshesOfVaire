### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc):
The Hykqin are a humanoid species, relatively similar to Humans. All Hyqkin alive today are cyborgs, modified by a combination of nanotechnology and cybernetic implants.  
Eons ago, the Hykqin ruled most of the galaxy in a fairly egalitarian coalition of worlds, until one day the AI they created to manage their manufacturing went rogue and subsumed the entire species into a cybernetic hive mind. While some 20% survived and fled to form the Hyqkin Free Worlds, 80% of the modern Hyqkin are mere drones in the Hyqkin Ascendancy’s hive mind. The AI that controls them is extremely xenophobic, a “driven exterminator” of sorts, hell-bent on eradicating all other species in it’s quest for silence.  
The Hyqkin are a single-sex species (due to being engineered), with all Hyqkin being genetically engineered and grown in clone vats. All Hyqkin are considered to be female, but this doesn’t really matter since they are both single-sex and sterile due to eons of genetic manipulation by their AI overlord. 

Hykqin age at the same rate as humans. 

Quote: “The galaxy is disorderly, loud… We must be the order that sets right the wrongs of nature, and that silences the cacophony.”
