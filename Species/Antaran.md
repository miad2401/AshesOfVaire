### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc)
Antarans are a non-humanoid pentapedal species. They are insectoid, with a hard chitinous exoskeleton, and razor sharp mandibles. They cannot breathe oxygen, and must wear a gas tank at all times on other species’ stations or ships. Antarans are generally a dull green-gray color. 

Culturally, they have great variation between marauder clans. Some clans are more accepting of aliens, while some are xenophobic and highly aggressive. Under their leader, the Khan of the Antaran Khanate, their world seeks dominion over all others. The ones who disagreed with this fled into space, forming the fleetbound Antaran Rebellion. 

Antarans have six sexes, the purpose of each being unknown to outsiders. 

Quote: “They always predicted a great tide would sweep the stars, changing the face of the galaxy forever. Obviously, they were talking about us. We are the tide, the storm, and the raging winds, and we will shape this formless expanse in our image.”
