Vairans (+ android)
===============================

### Homeworld/Home System Description: 
The Vairan homeworld, Vaire, was obliterated in a great tragedy decades ago. Now they hail from orbital habitats around their former homeworld. 

Ilveyna, their home system, has five planets and two asteroid belts. The orbital habitats they live on are blocky goliaths, built with the purpose of holding billions of people. The space around them is dotted with defense platforms and military shipyards.  

Layout: (Ilveyna, Ilveyna Primus (barren High-metal-content), Vaire + orbitals, asteroid belt Ilveyna AB1, gas giant Ilveyna III (+ 4 moons), Asteroid belt Ilveyna AB2, Ilveyna IV (barren ice world), Ilveyna V ( Ice giant)

Home Star: Ilveyna (Class A white main sequence star)


### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc):
Vairans are a mammalian species native to Vaire, a water world. They have grey-blue skin due to their copper based blood. As vaire is a low gravity world, they are generally taller than humans, standing at about 6.4 feet tall on average. They have a blue crystalline “fur” that grows on their lower arms, calves, hands, and ears, that functions as a natural armor (as a defense against the predatory crustaceans of their homeworld.  
Vairans are omnivores, and additionally they must consume silicon to remain healthy. Their hair colors tend to be vibrant, as their hair helps them store filtered out metal salts. Lack of these metal salts will bleach their hair white. Vairans also have four feline-esque ears, two on each side of their head. The reason for this is unknown.  
Vairans have two sexes, although they have little dimorphism, with both Male and Female Vairans appearing very androgynous, the main differences being that female vairans tend to be slightly taller than males, and very slightly more slender. Vairans have no hierarchy based on sex, with males and females both traditionally holding positions of power. They tend to be extremely egalitarian and fairly friendly towards aliens.  
Vairans age at a rate of 1 Vairan year to 3 Earth years, giving them a lifespan in the range of ~200 years on average.  84% of Vairans are part of a pair of twins, a quirk of their genetics.  
Vairan corporations include VaireTECH, a government-sponsored co-op that manufactures Vairan Union military equipment, food rations, civilian ships, and computer technology. Horizon One, a Vairan megacorporation, is one of the major asteroid mining and ice hauling firms in the Quadratus arm. Horizon One also runs a military contracting division, Horizon Storm, which manufactures stealth technology for use in Vairan Cruisers, as well as the ubiquitous Vairan Marine battlesuit, the Hurricane Mech Chassis. 

Quote: “The ashes of our home have not yet cooled, yet still we stand. We will not submit to terror, and we will not lay down and die. We will not let this befall anyone else. For as long as our species holds breath, this will NEVER happen again.**

### Androids
Androids tend to have green or cyan crystals, as well as glowing indicator lights on their chest, sides, or arms. These lights are the same color as their eyes, which also glow. Vairan androids’ mouths also are the same color as their lights, and mildly luminescent.
