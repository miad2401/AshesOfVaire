### Description (sexes, rate of aging, culture, etc)
Humans have not changed much in the years since the destruction of Earth and their arrival in the Quadratus Arm. They are a bipedal species of ape, with a wide variety of skin tones, cultures, and identities. They tend to be seen as “space gremlins”, primarily due to their love for creating bizarre machines, and their seeming lack of a self-preservation drive. This a trait that they have embraced wholeheartedly. If you see a human, rest assured that while it may be absolutely insane, if you can befriend it it will protect you with its life. 

Humans have two sexes on average, although extensive genetic modification has muddied the waters in this domain. Unlike most species in the Quadratus Arm, they have a history of discrimination based on sex and gender, but they have moved past this shameful period of their past in the centuries spent in deep space. 

Humans live aboard massive “Ark” type mobile space stations, enormous O’Neil Cylinders outfitted with an exotic form of FTL drive that uses probabilistic effects to jump between stars. 

If a human tells you to watch it do something, run.

### Androids
Human androids tend to be more mechanical looking, with noticeably pale skin, mechanical exoskeletons, and usually red or yellow eyes.
