## Inciting event
In late 3350, the galaxy was shaken to its core by the most senseless and horrific tragedy in generations. Early in the morning on June 5th, 3350, the [[Vairan]] homeworld and capital of the Union of Allied Systems, Vaire, was rendered uninhabitable by the hypervelocity impact of a Hry’Va’Ka Worldrazer, a vessel the size of a small moon, composed of the accumulated fused wreckages of vessels lost mid-jump in Transit Space. The vessel plummeted through Vaire’s atmosphere, slamming into the ocean at nearly 5 percent the speed of light. The extreme heat from this impact cracked the planet's crust, and blasted a good 10% of it’s atmosphere into space at escape velocity. The cerulean oceans that once covered 86% of the surface of the planet boiled off in mere hours as a shockwave circled the globe more than 300 times, pulverizing cities and tearing apart evacuating starships. A global firestorm soon followed, scorching the planet’s surface into nought but ashes and glass, instantly vaporizing any organic matter in its path.
  
While Vaire has since cooled and its oceans have returned, it is no longer capable of hosting complex life. Its surface is little more than barren rock dotted by volcanoes triggered from the impact. The organic materials in the soil have been destroyed, and much of the surface rendered sterile. Only the hardiest extremophile bacteria survived, deep in the bedrock of the world. The disaster also impacted the entire Union, fracturing it into three distinct factions. As the Union’s entire command structure was killed in the chaos, the regional Sector Command offices in the [[Vaar]]i Sector and Illenia Sector ended up branching off, taking control of their regional fleets, and forming their own nations. Vaire, and a handful of nearby systems were left to the survivors, gathered above their shattered world on repurposed colony ships, cargo carriers, and orbital habitats.  
  
Nearly 50% of the Vairan species was killed in the attack, with the 30% living offworld and the 20% that evacuated being the last survivors of the Devastation. While some, such as the Vaari Republic, lamented the fall of Vaire, and chose to help the survivors, some factions such as the Illenian Union saw the Devastation as a sign that they had expanded too far into the stars, withdrawing to a few fortress worlds and banning travel outside of their controlled systems lest the sin of exploration bring the wrath of the cosmos upon them.  
  
While the Vairans did survive as a species, their old philosophy of pacifism and diplomacy suffered greatly. Now, scarred by the horrors that befell them, they guard their worlds with an enormous fleet of stealth ships and bulk command vessels capable of taking down capital ships before the enemy can even see them. The survivors (mostly Vairans and Vairan-Model Androids) formed the Vairan Union shortly after the Devastation, moving most of their populations into artificial habitat structures and megastructures such as O’neill cylinders and Ringworlds. They maintain good relations with the Vaari Republic and [[Kiyan]] Federation. The Vairan Union is at war with the Illenian Union with a disarmament wargoal Casus Belli, as they have terrible relations after the Illixe abandoned the Vairans to their fate.

### Addendums
- The Terran Exodus is a fleet of six Ark-ships fleeing the destruction of Earth, carrying the remnants of humanity. Earth was destroyed in-universe when a star passing the solar system disturbed Jupiter's orbit, pulling the inner planets into new orbits and moving Earth out of the habitable zone. 
- UMBRA is a Non-Governmental organization functioning as a PMC. They specifically hunt Horror vessels, and respond to extradimensional threats. -the Vairan Union is the true remnant of the old Union of Allied Systems, consisting of a handful of systems around the Union's old capital world, Vaire. They are allied with the Vaari Republic, a nearby great power that acts as a buffer between them and the resurgent menaces in the galactic north. The Vairan Union has a population of approximately 9.8 billion, 6.3 billion of it's citizens being Vairans, the native species of Vaire. Approximately 10 billion Vairans survived the destruction of their homeworld, the majority of whom either joined the Vaari Republic or Vairan Union. The Vairan Union also has a significant population of Vairan-Model Androids, although these synthetic beings are counted as Vairans, just the same as their organic brethren. For a point of reference, the surrounding powers have populations of 17.5 billion (Kiyan Federation), 15.34 billion (Illenian Union), and 20.1 billion (Vaari Republic) respectively.
