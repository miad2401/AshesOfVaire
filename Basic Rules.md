# Getting Started
### Setting Stats
Set your HP to 10, you roll a 1d10 for each addition.
Roll 6d20 and decide what roll corresponds to what stat
Saves are calculated by 1/5th of the base stat down to a minimum of 1
Roll 1d10 for ballistic and melee skills each. Reroll 10s.
Next we get to the skill proficiencies.
Take one proficiency from the following list:
- Acrobatics
- Survivalism
- Piloting
- Engineering

Darkvision is determined by species.
Stealth is for specific checks and uses a 1d6 roll.
Next decide your [[Species]], [[Classes]](Class) and [[Factions]](Faction). Each of these will have an effect or stat change you need to note on your sheet.

### Leveling Up
On level-up, roll a 1d4 and add the result to your **base** HP. You can roll a 1d10 for your ballistic and melee skill and if it is lower you can replace your skills with that.

### Health
When you reach 0 HP you are knocked out. If you are damaged past 0 HP you begin to take mortal damage and have to roll death saves. Biological characters heal at a rate of 2 HP per half-hour when not in combat.

### Armor
Armor Ranges from Scout to Heavy.
Heavy armor decreases speed by 2 meters per turn, but decreases damage by 1d6 points. (Typhoon, Hurricane, Tempest)

Scout armor does not decrease speed, and decreases damage by 1d4 points. (Phantom, Poltergeist, Moonrise)

**All** players will start with either civilian clothing (jumpsuits, normal clothes), a Vacuum Suit pressurized jumpsuit with a removable helmet and oxygen recycler), or a Hazard Exoskeleton (a motorized metal frame over a jumpsuit of some sort). **None** of these offer any effects. Vacuum Suits can protect from void exposure and toxic atmospheres, and are found in **All** airlocks.

### Androids
Androids are immune to High-G environments and toxic atmospheres. Android characters cannot heal normally, and must be repaired during Rests.

### Environmental Effects
Some worlds or stations may have no atmosphere or a toxic atmosphere. Androids are immune to atmospheric effects, but most players will by default have a vacuum suit capable of handling hazardous environments. For more exotic hazards such as high radiation, a Radiation suit will be provided.
