# Ships
Vessels *mostly* will not have artificial gravity, and will generate gravity through acceleration. High-G burns may cause damage to characters or cause effects such as rolls with disadvantage. Androids are immune to High-G environments and toxic atmospheres.

## Ship to Ship Combat
At some point in the game, you will encounter a hostile vessel while traveling in space. The void of space is quite hostile to life and as such, space combat can be very deadly.

Space vessels have their own HP and Ballistic Skill. If your ship is destroyed, all occupants that do not evacuate die.
A vessel's **hit roll** is it's Ballistic Skill combined with the Ballistic Skill of the vessel's gunner.
For ship to ship combat, you have to have rules set up for Vessel Ballistic Skill, player ballistic skill, vessel speed/G-force acceleration and vessel weapons (Heat-seeking nuclear missiles, laser weapons, PDCs, Spinal Railguns)

Space vessels carry four weapon types:
| Weapon | Damage Type | Damage | Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Missiles | | 1d6 | |
| Seeker Nuclear Missiles | Radiation | 1d10 | |
| Thermal Lasers | | 1d4 | |
| Point Defense Cannons (PDC) | | 1d4 | Possibility to shoot down nuclear missiles on a coin flip result of **Heads**|
| Spinal Railguns | Piercing | 1d10 | Successful hits depressurize ship compartments.|
