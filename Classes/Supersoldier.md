# Supersoldier
When a character reaches level 30, they may opt to take the supersoldier class as a multiclass. This **completely** replaces the previous class the player held.

Supersoldiers **always** start with 45 HP, regardless of previous HP.
Supersoldiers **always** move after normal players or normal NPCs.
Supersoldiers have a maximum of 3 GRes (Gravity Resistance).
Supersoldiers may take superheavy weapons.
Supersoldiers have a **base** infamy of 20, to reflect hot intimidating it is to have a 15 foot tall gene-hardened bio-technological juggernaut stare you down.
