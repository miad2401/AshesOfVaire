The Overseer hired a bunch of maniacs I guess
Also he's evil and declared war on the galaxy
The overseer is just a really shitty guy tbh
Also the party saved River Greenwell, the daughter of Prime Minister Greenwell of the Vairan Union
Oh I forgot.
Miniboss 1, Cameron, The generally awful guy, has been defeated
so just a little overview on the scale of the war that y'all are looking at: The Vairan Union and Vaari Republic declared war on the UMBRA Foundation as a police action. The Illenian Union _may_ declare war soon. The Hykqin Ascendancy is using the war to begin expanding into Illenian Union and Vaari Republic space. UMBRA will likely begin a drawn out guerilla campaign combined with planetary invasions and further planetary bombardment. It is likely that if they aren't stopped, an repeat of the Devastation may happen. Your goal is to track down the people in charge of UMBRA and either terminate or incapacitate them. This is easier said than done. Also, while the Overseer is evil, he is not the person you should be most scared of.
