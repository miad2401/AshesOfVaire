BIO:
Star was born on the Vairan homeworld of Vaire and had a seemingly normal childhood. She was born to River Summerbloom, a captain if the union military, and Vailaria Wovenwater, a scientist aboard a research station. When the day of devastation came, Star was in school and was quickly evacuated on one of the first ships out. Her father stayed on the planet to help organize the evacuation efforts and he died as the planet cracked and boiled. This event would spur the young varian to pursue a future where they could help right the tragegy, or prevent another. This led to her joining the navy when she came of age and serving as a engineer aboard one of the many starships in the union navy.
